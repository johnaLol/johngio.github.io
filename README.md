This is a personal website that will display all that my mind has to offer---whether that's some creative writings, my Course 6 pset work and analysis from MIT, or development of my game Truthdancer.

In addition, I hope to add some interactability such that it is not a static website.

Ultimately, I want this website to be my passion project, and one of my greatest achievements.
